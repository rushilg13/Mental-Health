        Dear Diary, <br>
        This website is specifically designed and made for people from VIT, Vellore to share their stories with people anonymously.
        With soaring rates of depression and other mental health related issues, We believe it would be better for people to
        voice out their stories. The platform is completely anonymous and its upto the user if he/she wants to post their stories
        with their name. We would appreciate people to use the Author-Name as 'Anonymous' who wants to share their story secretly.
        We have added a list of counsellors from our college who would be happy to help and listen to your story. Feel free to reach
        out to them.<br>
        Bye, Diary
